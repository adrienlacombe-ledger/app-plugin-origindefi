# Overview

## Why Zemu?

Integration and end-to-end testing of Ledger Apps is a manual and time consuming process. We believe that the Ledger
apps ecosystem is lacking an adequate approach with respect to testing. The Zemu Framework is our solution for this
problem. We stand on the shoulders of the giant [greenknotâ€™s](https://github.com/greenknot) speculos.

It's currently being used in every Ledger App built by Zondax, among many others (such as Ethereum one built by Ledger
team).

_Zemu is an emulation and testing framework for Ledger Nano S/S+/X devices_

## Features
